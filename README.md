# Airport Control Tower Simulation System

🎓 Academic project developed as part of the **Data Structures** course, aimed at simulating the operation of an **airport control tower** and selected **airport services**, inspired by the new Luanda International Airport.

This project focuses on applying fundamental **data structures concepts** through a real-world inspired simulation.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project was to design and implement a **simulation system** that represents the functioning of an airport control tower and passenger services.

The project was developed strictly for **academic purposes**, with the objective of evaluating students' understanding of data structures learned during the semester.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Simulate the operation of an airport control tower  
- Develop solutions for selected airport services  
- Implement a program that represents the proposed problem  
- Consolidate knowledge acquired throughout the semester  

---

## 🛠️ Methodology
After fully understanding the problem, the development team was divided into two main parts:

- **Frontend (Main Program):**
  - Responsible for the main control flow and user interaction

- **Backend (Functional Logic):**
  - Control Tower operations  
  - Passenger Service management  

The system was implemented in **C**, making extensive use of **Abstract Data Types (ADT)** and core data structures such as:
- Lists  
- Queues  
- (Conceptually) Stacks  

The project consists of **500+ lines of well-commented code**, structured into clear and reusable functions to ensure readability, efficiency, and maintainability.
